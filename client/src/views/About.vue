    <p><strong>Kanban (看板)</strong> (signboard or billboard in Japanese) is a scheduling system for lean manufacturing and just-in-time
      manufacturing (JIT). Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban to improve manufacturing
      efficiency. Kanban is one method to achieve JIT. The system takes its name from the cards that track production
      within a factory. For many in the automotive sector, Kanban is known as the "Toyota nameplate system" and as such
      the term is not used by some other automakers.Kanban became an effective tool to support running a production
      system as a whole, and an excellent way to promote improvement. Problem areas are highlighted by measuring lead
      time and cycle time of the full process and process steps. One of the main benefits of
      kanban is to establish an upper limit to work in process inventory to avoid overcapacity. Other systems with
      similar effect are for example CONWIP. A systematic study of various configurations of kanban systems, of
      which CONWIP is an important special case, can be found in Tayur (1993), among other papers. A goal of
      the kanban system is to limit the buildup of excess inventory at any point in production. Limits on the number of
      items waiting at supply points are established and then reduced as inefficiencies are identified and removed.
      Whenever a limit is exceeded, this points to an inefficiency that should be addressed.</p>
